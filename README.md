# Prediction Assignment Writeup

# Introduction

This is a requirement in the Practical Machine Learning course by Johns Hopkins University. The goal of this assignment is to predict the manner of the subject (6 participants) performed exercises. The data was obtained from devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. In order to predict the manner of the subject did the exercises we will be using the decision tree and random forest methods to determine the best prediction with the highest accuracy possible.

# Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
